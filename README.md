This code performs hierarchical and K-Means clustering analysis on COVID-19 world data. The data contains information about different countries, such as population, new cases, new deaths, new recoveries, total cases, total deaths, active cases, critical cases, total recovered, and total tests. The purpose of this code is to summarize the data in a meaningful way that will enable us to cluster countries based on different attributes.

Installation
The code is written in Python 3. To run this code, you will need to install the following libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, yellowbrick, and scipy. You can install these libraries using pip. To install the libraries, run the following command in your terminal:

python
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn yellowbrick scipy
Usage
To use this code, you need to have the COVID-19 world data CSV file. You should replace the file path with your own file path. You can run the code in any Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook or Spyder.

Dataset
The COVID-19 world data CSV file contains information about different countries, such as population, new cases, new deaths, new recoveries, total cases, total deaths, active cases, critical cases, total recovered, and total tests. The data is obtained from the Our World in Data website.

Data Preprocessing
The first step in the analysis is to understand the dataset by examining the number of columns and rows, the types of data stored in the dataset, and the number of missing values in each column. The missing values are filled by the mean of the column, and the null values in "New Cases" and "New Deaths" are filled with zeros.

Feature Extraction
We extract the following features for clustering analysis: population, total death per million, total case per million, total test per million, active cases per million, and critical cases per million.

Clustering Analysis
We perform hierarchical and K-Means clustering analysis on the extracted features. We use the elbow method and silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters. We then visualize the clusters using a scatter plot.

Conclusion
This code enables us to cluster countries based on different attributes. The clustering analysis can be useful in identifying patterns and trends in COVID-19 data, which can be used for further analysis and decision-making.
